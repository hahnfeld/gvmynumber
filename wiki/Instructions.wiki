=GVMyNumber Instructions=

==Note==

*Due to a proximity sensing bug on some phones, you may need to wait until the numbers are dialed (5-6 seconds) before you put the phone to your head.  If you don't do this, some required dial tones may not be sent!*

==Instructions==

  # Go to http://voice.google.com/ and register for a Google Voice account.
  # Under Google's "settings" menu, add your mobile phone number.  Then click on "Edit", "Show Advanced Setings", and make sure "direct access to voicemail" is enabled.
  # If you want free outgoing calls, configure your Google Voice number as a "free" number with your mobile carrier.
  # Configure your Google Voice number (and PIN if needed) in GVMyNumber under "settings".
  # Make sure the official Android Google Voice dialer is enabled, and start making calls.  Your own number should appear on the screen!

==Tips==

  * You must dial the area code/country code, or Google Voice will reject the call.
  * Be sure you select "direct access to voicemail" in the Google Voice "advanced settings" menu for your mobile phone number.
  * In some cases, the phone may start dialing too soon after calling your google voice number. If this happens, simply configure a longer pause in the GVMyNumber settings menu. If the pause needs to be variable, there is a "Prompt" option that will prompt you to begin the dialing sequence after calling.
